\section{BibTeX}

BibTeX should be used for referencing. JabRef (an open source tool for Windows) is recommended for the management of references. 

The LaTeX source document of this pdf document provides you with different samples for references to journals~\cite{jour:B2BServices}, conference papers~\cite{proc:TheWebMLApproach}, books~\cite{book:umlatwork}, book chapters~\cite{incoll:ErhardKonrad1992}, electronic standards~\cite{man:BPEL}, dissertations~\cite{phdthesis:manuelWimmer}, masters' theses~\cite{mast:AUMLProfile}, and web sites~\cite{misc:BIGWebsite}. The respective BibTeX entries may be found in the file \texttt{references.bib}. For administration of the BibTeX references we recommend \url{http://www.citeulike.org} or JabRef for offline administration, respectively.
