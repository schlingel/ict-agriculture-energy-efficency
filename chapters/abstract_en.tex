\chapter*{Abstract}

Energy efficiency in agriculture is as important as never before. The industrial countries have to work under massive cost pressure whereas developing countries have to compensate their scarcity of resources like watter or electrical energy. The purpose of this work is to give an overview of the the most important research topics for this matter.

The approach for was to find papers which are about the most important research topics defined by the agenda for transnational co-operation on energy efficiency in agriculture of the EU. 

As result this paper shows a survey of papers for mathematical optimization models, sensor network technology, GIS-systems, artificial intelligence and planning systems like decision support systems. The essence of this work is the presentation suitable solutions for optimizing processes and resource consumption.
